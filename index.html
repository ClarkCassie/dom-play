        <p id="intro">Here, I take a snippet of script from a film and 
            use events and event handlers to highlight all of one actors 
            lines while simultaneously unhighlighting another actors lines 
            all on the on-click event. Click on any one of the actors 
            lines to highlight all or their lines on the script. 
            Click on one of the lines of a different actor to unhighlight 
            the current lines and highlight the new ones.</p>

            <p class="scene">Anakin jumps and flips onto OBI-WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps 
                toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.</p>

                then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. 
                Anakin tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava. 
                Anakin struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. 
                His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.</p>

            <p><span data-actor="obiwan"><strong>OBI-WAN:</strong> (continuing) ... You were the Chosen One! 
                It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them. 
                It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.</span></p>
            
            <!--Scene Description-->
            <p class="scene">Obi-wan picks up Anakin's lightsaber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.</p>
